# HermitePolynomial
1. This repository includes MATLAB programs for calculating and plotting the Hermite polynomials. You can show a graph using PlotHermite.m.
2. The function named "Hermite" calculates the value of the Hermite polynomials. You do not have to modify this code. In the other code named "PlotHermite," you can find two adjustable parameters (xmin and v) and one optional parameter (dx). The first parameter xmin is the minimum value of x. Your graph will be shown in the range of [xmin:-xmin]. It should be noted that xmin is a negative value. The other parameter v is used to specify the order of the Hermite polynomials. Therefore, v should be 0 or a positive integer. 
3. Possible application: Calculation of vibrational wave functions.
